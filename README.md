# AI-Therapist-App-with-voice-based-chat-interface
 am seeking an experienced developer to create an AI voicechat. It will be an AI therapist web application. The app should provide a voice-based chat experience similar to ChatGPT's voice chat (extremely fast latency and realistic voice) and be accessible on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Key Features:

1. Voice-Based Chat Interface:
- Implement a voice-enabled chatbot that interacts with users through speech.
- Ensure compatibility and responsiveness across all devices and browsers.
- Extremely fast latency and realistic voice
- You can direct me as to which APIs & servers you'd like me to sign up for

2. User Trial and Subscription System:
- Set up a user flow where users sign up for a trial by paying $1 for a 2-minute session.
- After the trial, implement automated monthly billing at $27 USD/month.
- Include the ability to modify the trial period length and pricing from an admin panel.
- Implement a payment gateway (stripe) for secure transactions.

3. Chat History and Personalization:
- Enable chat history retention so the AI learns and adapts to the user's previous interactions.
- Ensure data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations.

4. Customizable AI Prompt and Responses:
- Provide an admin interface to modify the AI bot's initial prompt and guide its response patterns.
- Allow for ongoing adjustments to improve user experience.

5. User Engagement Flow:
- The chatbot should introduce itself upon the user's first interaction. I will provide the initial output for the chatbot.
- After the trial period ends, pause the conversation and prompt the user to continue with a subscription at an introductory rate of $27/month instead of $87/month for unlimited therapy.
- Upon subscription, users can continue their session without interruptions.

**Deliverables:**
- A fully functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the AI Therapist web app.
- Admin panel to modify chatbot prompts and trial settings.
- Source code and deployment instructions.
- Post-launch support for bug fixes and potential feature enhancements.
- ====================
- To create the AI therapist web application with a voice-based chat interface using Tkinter for the desktop app, we can break down the requirements and build a structure. We will also use Python libraries like SpeechRecognition for voice input, gTTS for speech output, and Flask to handle web-related functionalities. Stripe will be used for payments, and we’ll need to integrate an AI chatbot API for the voice chat functionality (such as OpenAI or a custom AI service).

Here is a sample implementation for creating the MVP:
Key Steps:

    Voice-based Chat Interface: Using SpeechRecognition and gTTS.
    User Trial and Subscription: Use Stripe API for handling payments and user flows.
    Chat History and Personalization: Store conversation history in a database (like SQLite).
    Admin Interface: Use a simple admin panel for controlling the chatbot prompts.

Libraries to Install:

pip install SpeechRecognition gTTS Flask stripe sqlite3

Basic Python Code for Tkinter-based Desktop AI Voice Chat:

import tkinter as tk
import speech_recognition as sr
from gtts import gTTS
import os
import stripe
from tkinter import messagebox
import sqlite3

# Initialize Stripe
stripe.api_key = "your-stripe-api-key"

# Database Setup
def setup_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect("chat_history.db")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS history (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            user_input TEXT,
            bot_response TEXT
        )
    """)
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def save_conversation(user_input, bot_response):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("chat_history.db")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO history (user_input, bot_response) VALUES (?, ?)", (user_input, bot_response))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Voice recognition function
def recognize_speech():
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
        print("Listening...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    try:
        user_input = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"User said: {user_input}")
        return user_input
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, I did not understand that.")
        return "Sorry, I did not understand that."
    except sr.RequestError:
        print("Sorry, the speech service is down.")
        return "Sorry, the service is down."

# Generate Speech from Text
def speak(text):
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save("response.mp3")
    os.system("start response.mp3")

# Handle the conversation (AI integration can be done here)
def process_conversation():
    user_input = recognize_speech()
    # Here you can integrate with your AI model (e.g., OpenAI GPT)
    # For simplicity, let's assume a predefined response
    bot_response = "I'm your AI therapist. How can I help you today?"
    
    # Display in the UI
    chat_box.insert(tk.END, f"You: {user_input}\n")
    chat_box.insert(tk.END, f"Bot: {bot_response}\n")
    save_conversation(user_input, bot_response)
    
    # Speak out the response
    speak(bot_response)

# Payment Integration (with Stripe)
def create_payment_intent():
    try:
        intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
            amount=100,  # Amount in cents ($1 = 100 cents)
            currency='usd',
            description='Trial Session for AI Therapist'
        )
        return intent.client_secret
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Failed to create payment intent.")
        return None

# Start Payment Process
def initiate_payment():
    client_secret = create_payment_intent()
    if client_secret:
        # Here you would integrate Stripe's front-end library to handle payment flow
        print(f"Payment successful, client secret: {client_secret}")
        messagebox.showinfo("Success", "Payment successful. You can now continue your session.")

# Main Window Setup
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("AI Therapist - Voice Chat")
root.geometry("400x500")

# Set up the UI components
chat_box = tk.Text(root, height=20, width=50)
chat_box.pack()

btn_start_conversation = tk.Button(root, text="Start Conversation", command=process_conversation)
btn_start_conversation.pack()

btn_payment = tk.Button(root, text="Start Trial ($1)", command=initiate_payment)
btn_payment.pack()

# Initialize DB
setup_db()

# Run the main loop
root.mainloop()

Features Implemented:

    Voice Recognition: Uses speech_recognition to convert speech into text and gTTS to convert AI responses back into speech.
    Trial and Subscription System: Initiates a trial payment via Stripe. For now, it's a simplified mock-up. You would need to integrate Stripe’s JavaScript library on the frontend to complete the flow.
    Chat History: Stores user and AI responses in a simple SQLite database.
    Basic UI: Uses Tkinter for a simple chat window where users can click to start the conversation or start the trial payment.

Considerations:

    Security & Privacy: Ensure sensitive data like payment and user history is handled securely.
    AI Integration: For better AI responses, integrate with an AI service like OpenAI GPT to generate dynamic responses instead of static ones.
    Stripe Integration: Stripe requires front-end integration as well (using Stripe.js for handling card details securely). The backend (Python) will handle payment processing.

Improvements & Additions:

    Subscription Management: Integrate a full subscription model with recurring billing for users after the trial.
    Admin Panel: Implement a web-based admin interface to manage chatbot prompts, trial periods, and pricing.
    Advanced AI Integration: Use OpenAI GPT or other advanced models to personalize and humanize responses, and implement a learning mechanism based on user interaction.

This structure provides a basic MVP to start with, and additional functionalities like customization of prompts, and better payment handling can be integrated as needed.
